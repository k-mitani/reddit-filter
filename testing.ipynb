I&#39;m a beginner and have not done any game dev in the past.</p> <p><strong>Brief outline of specs</strong></p> <p>The board game has several independent hexagonal boards (which I want to split into different scenes/tabs) irl, each board is played by a separate players. I would want to have a separate tab for each board. Each such board needs to support being able to drag and drop hexagonal pieces on the grid (and from/to a reinforcements/casualty area). Also I would love the ability to snap pieces to the hexagonal grid.There also must be a generic master tab (irl played by another separate player) which keeps track of money and lets you buy units (hexagon shape) and assign them to the various boards (and also sense information from all the boards at end of turn). This generic tab must also be able to unlock new tyoes of units that can be bought. The actual board game has a few more features but I intend to start with these.</p> <p>I also do not intend to add legality checks at the start of the game, and will do that later, after I have a simple working version.</p> <p>____________________________________</p> <p>I was wondering what sort of platform would be the most convenient for developing this sort of game. I want to start with having the ability to play all sides of the game on a single laptop, but might eventually want to create a web version that syncs several different players, or some other way to sync between different players. I have never developed any video games in the past but have some generic software engineering and competitive programming experience.</p> <p>I initially tried implementing this game using tkinter but tkinter doesn&#39;t really feel as if it were built for this purpose. Are there other python libraries that would be better? Despite being a first time game-dev, should I try and meddle in unity or some other game engine?</p> <p>I would also greatly appreciate any advice on getting started. I did go through a few videos with generic advice, but considering that the game rules are set in stone, there is no story (and no music), I&#39;m unsure if this should change how I approach this personal project.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/AFriendlyCat7\"> /u/AFriendlyCat7 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amzfzm/suggested_platform_for_developing_hexagonal/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amzfzm/suggested_platform_for_developing_hexagonal/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T21:40:09+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T21:40:09+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amzfzm/suggested_platform_for_developing_hexagonal/',\n   'tag': 'gamedev',\n   'author': '/u/AFriendlyCat7',\n   'title': 'Suggested Platform for Developing hexagonal strategy board game with multiple scenes'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1and41o/i_added_new_magnet_particle_indicators_to_my/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/eWo2ajh0dWJmcWhjMaNsM__Z8JvmlVf1Vm6XRw9HubmGny01eI6g0ZrtJ2Bz.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=500a8ae5af788167cda98bfde3b203cab470cfb2\" alt=\"I added new magnet particle indicators to my upcoming puzzle game.

My overall goal is to make clothing items with effects, proper movement and can be used in applications that allow vrms, such as Craftopia and VSeeFace. I&#39;m currently stuck between two paths.</p> <p>I really like the Poiyomi shader but it locks me into 2019.31f1. The shader does work with VSeeFace but not with Craftopia. I thought that I could maybe add some features to the MToon shader but I can&#39;t find a proper rendering pipeline for this version of Unity. All attempts have caused errors that I don&#39;t understand. I also can&#39;t use Magica Cloth 2 as that requires a later version. I&#39;ve been debating getting the first version of Magica Cloth or just doing all the work the hard way.</p> <p>My second train of thought was to get the latest version of Unity and use the URP. In going in this direction, Poiyomi is out and I don&#39;t like the Liltoon shader as it is not as user friendly. I haven&#39;t gotten far enough with it to even see if it will render in the programs I want to use it with. The latest version of URP doesn&#39;t seem compatible with MToon and I&#39;m not sure there is a decent replacement. I haven&#39;t even tried Magica Cloth 2 yet.</p> <p>Do either of these paths have a proper solution or is there another way of doing things that I&#39;m missing?</p> <p>And if you&#39;re wondering why I don&#39;t use Blender, I will eventually.

We are still in the process of deciding whether or not to use a typewriter effect for our dialog in the game (a story-driven Metroidvania). Our game is fully dubbed, so it has a voiceover for every dialog.<br/> The process is currently as follows: The players start a dialog, the VoiceOver is started and the dialog is played with a typewriter effect. If &quot;Confirm&quot; is pressed once, the complete text is displayed and the VoiceOver is skipped; to continue, &quot;Confirm&quot; must be pressed again.<br/> On the one hand, we wanted to convey a more immersive feeling that resembles an actual dialog, on the other hand, we force the player to enter another keystroke, which can be perceived as annoying.

I&#39;ll try to keep this as brief as possible. I&#39;m working on an RPG game and could use some help deciding how to handle the combat scenes in my game. The combat mechanics are classic turn based (like Deltarune, Mario and Luigi RPG games, Pokemon, etc.) where the player explores an open world and runs into monsters they fight in a separate arena. </p> <p>Because of this separation, there are two methods I see for handling combat. I could either load a scene (probably additively) and then unload it after combat is complete, or instantiate a prefab that is destroyed when combat is complete. I was leaning towards the latter, but I&#39;m not committed yet to either. I&#39;m afraid of going down one path and realizing the cons of that path when it&#39;s too late.

To be precise, the game only accumulated a measly 50 wishlists and I was only able to sell around 30 units.</p> <p>A quick link to the game:</p> <p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2593410/Cubyte/\">https://store.steampowered.com/app/2593410/Cubyte/</a></p> <p>Please let me know what, if anything, raised a red flag. I can only see my horrible small capsule image being a reason as to why my impressions took a bad hit, but other than that, nothing comes to mind. FYI, the store page had been checked out over 12500 times, so I can only assume I messed up somewhere there that turned them off. Thanks for your time.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>EDIT: First off, we thank everyone for the feedback! On another note, we have now decided to make the game free (though we are currently waiting for Steam to approve our request). Feel free to check it out once the price updates!</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>EDIT II: I feel inclined to mention that this game was created and published on Itch back when we were in middle school, and released on Steam without changing too much.

I have no experience with programming or building websites, though am willing to learn and reach out to others for assistance, am under no time constraints and am not doing any of this for money. So I can be leisurely about this, purely just want to do it because I want to bring some of my ideas to life. </p> <p>I want to make a website to create and host a few browser-based versions of board games I have made in real life. A potentially unique and maybe difficult piece of this, is that for a few of them I would like to be able to have both the traditional turn-based game play, or a real-time strategy mode (in analog I use sand timers for this and it does actually work though a bit finicky). These games are way simpler than your computer based RTS like Age of Empires or Starcraft—for a better idea, think of a game of chess, but instead of taking turns, each individual piece has like a 30 second timer, and when the timer for an individual piece is up, it is free to move again when you direct it to (flip the sand timer over). So you and your opponent are juggling multiple pieces simultaneously. My games on some level are simpler than that even because there is like maybe 7 pieces per side. In other ways a bit more complicated because there is a bit more that you can do besides move and capture pieces. The entire “board” would all fit on one screen so no need to screen scroll, the commands from a user perspective are all simple enough to be able to be done with a mouse so no need for hotkeys etc. But it would have to be precise enough that for example a black bishop and a white knight that are both trying to move to the same spot, whichever user inputs that first would land on that spot first. </p> <p>The games also require randomized set up at the beginning so I would need to have that feature as well. </p> <p>This is for PvP only, over the internet. Most games are just 1v1, maybe a couple can go 4 or 5 player. No plan or desire to do AI of any sort. </p> <p>Would also like for it to be able to support a leaderboard/ladder where accounts have an ELO score based on performance. Not super interested in actual matchmaking though. </p> <p>Any suggestions regarding where to start would be greatly appreciated!

Etc. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NotTJButCJ\"> /u/NotTJButCJ </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1anstc3/hardcode_or_algorithm_for_wave_based_game_loop/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1anstc3/hardcode_or_algorithm_for_wave_based_game_loop/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-10T22:54:07+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-10T22:54:07+00:00',\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1anstc3/hardcode_or_algorithm_for_wave_based_game_loop/',\n   'tag': 'gamedev',\n   'author': '/u/NotTJButCJ',\n   'title': 'Hardcode or Algorithm for wave based game loop?'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amwe7w/a_dream_that_reminds_me_of_the_2000s/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/YWloeWdpd3YybWhjMbklRkgxw9otLI7pSfNHFaIFUZcuAECI3d3Stia0L6NZ.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3169d8f57dfc174b08166c2daa2cd2372a7c5f7\" alt=\"A dream that reminds me of the 2000s\" title=\"A dream that reminds me of the 2000s\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/EtherlightStudios\"> /u/EtherlightStudios </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/ef84kk2u2mhc1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amwe7w/a_dream_that_reminds_me_of_the_2000s/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T19:29:30+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T19:29:30+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amwe7w/a_dream_that_reminds_me_of_the_2000s/',\n   'tag': 'indiegames',\n   'author': '/u/EtherlightStudios',\n   'title': 'A dream that reminds me of the 2000s'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amox8o/which_of_these_will_work_better_as_a_steam_main/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/xnaqk115hkhc1.png?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7552b1c3996e01f96e3c7b063d3b154df0270538\" alt=\"Which of these will work better as a Steam main capsule?

I&#39;m an aspiring game dev. Due to a series of stupid events, I recently got fired from my job. This has left me with too much free time while I look for something to pay the bills. In the meantime, I want to finally start trying to fulfill my dream of making games. But it occurred to me that I don&#39;t actually have any idea how long this sort of thing takes. So I thought I might as well ask around to those who might know better. </p> <p>I&#39;m very new to game development. Still learning the ropes of programming (wouldn&#39;t say no if anyone has a reccomendation on a good engine. Currently deciding between GM2 &amp; Godot), getting the hang of pixel art, ect. So I&#39;m well aware that will add extra time to the process. </p> <p>I&#39;m hoping to start small. Make something that&#39;s maybe an hour or two. I think that&#39;s reasonable for something like this. Short, but satisfying. Something to get my foot in the door before I get to work on my real passion project. Without going into too much detail, my concept is a sort of 2D dungeon crawler format ala Zelda with its own mechanics. Pixel graphics, not super detailed (still undecided whether to lean more towards 8 or 16 bits), and doing pretty much everything by myself (though that might change)</p> <p>With all that in mind, based on personal experiences.. how long do you think it would take? Obviously a lot of different factors going into this sort of thing. But if I had to guess off the top of my head, maybe 6 months? I honestly don&#39;t know how far off I am with that sort of guess. Espesially when you have to factor in real world stuff like full time jobs and whatnot. I&#39;m sure it probably sounds ridiculous to some extreme.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/swordinthesleeve\"> /u/swordinthesleeve </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an9utk/solo_indie_dev_timeline_advice/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an9utk/solo_indie_dev_timeline_advice/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-10T06:23:47+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-10T06:23:47+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an9utk/solo_indie_dev_timeline_advice/',\n   'tag': 'gamedev',\n   'author': '/u/swordinthesleeve',\n   'title': 'Solo indie dev timeline advice'},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello, I am working on a city life sim game and I need a way to procedurally generate a city.

This game will feature leaderboards, allowing users to create personal usernames during account setup. To mitigate the use of inappropriate language, I plan to implement a filter that checks usernames against a list of prohibited words. Should a username contain any such language, an automatically generated, neutral username will be assigned, which the user can later change. Additionally, I intend to manually review usernames to identify and correct any false positives. Beyond this, I&#39;ll conduct daily audits for any usernames that might bypass the initial filter. Users will also have the ability to report offensive usernames they encounter on the leaderboards, which I may have missed during my reviews.</p> <p>My question revolves around the policies of Apple and Google concerning such matters, particularly in scenarios where offensive usernames might temporarily appear on the leaderboards until I can address them. What potential repercussions could arise in this scenario? Is there a need to adjust the app&#39;s rating to account for the possibility of such usernames, despite the game being designed for all age groups? I wish to avoid unnecessarily restricting access to the app by raising its age rating due to concerns over potentially offensive usernames.</p> <p>Given my aim to strike a balance between realism and caution, I acknowledge that I might be overthinking the situation, especially considering the game&#39;s uncertain popularity. However, I still want to prepare adequately for the eventuality of the game gaining significant traction, necessitating a more robust plan than what I currently envision.</p> <p>Understanding that I&#39;m likely not the first developer to face these considerations, I&#39;m eager to learn from the experiences of others. If anyone can share insights or advice based on similar challenges, it would be greatly appreciated.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/58696384896898676493\"> /u/58696384896898676493 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amx34t/managing_usergenerated_usernames_in_mobile_games/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amx34t/managing_usergenerated_usernames_in_mobile_games/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T19:59:25+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T19:59:25+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amx34t/managing_usergenerated_usernames_in_mobile_games/',\n   'tag': 'gamedev',\n   'author': '/u/58696384896898676493',\n   'title': 'Managing User-Generated Usernames in Mobile Games: Navigating Policies and Practices for the App Store and Google Play'},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;m developing a rhythm based game, and for part of it, the player is able to spawn note clusters in a guitar hero-like minigame.

It&#39;s a simple autonomous game where you can openly interact with characters to uncover a murder.<br/> CLUAIDO throws you into a Victorian mansion mystery where you&#39;ve got to suss out who offed Mr. Hamilton, with nothing but your wits and the ability to interrogate AI characters that think and react in real-time. Pretty cool, right?<br/> I&#39;m diving into creating initial concepts for games with autonomous worlds and thought, why not drag you all into this with me? I&#39;m all about sharing the ride and getting your takes and critiques early on. Might be a simple setup we&#39;re starting with, but who says it can&#39;t spark some cool new game concepts and mechanics in autonomous worlds?<br/> So, yeah, hop on board if you&#39;re up for it.<br/> Got the first devlog ready, breaking down CLUAIDO&#39;s concept and the initial brainstorm.

I’m also wondering if this is worth finishing or not, since there are other tools available already.</p> <p>I started making the tool because i didn’t really like the workflow of other tools out there, I also wanted a tool in which you could essentially test your map without leaving the editor. </p> <p>Anyway, I’m wondering if anyone here could see the use in this, because if so, I’ll maybe finish it. Otherwise, I’ll probably probably use my time for other projects.</p> <p>The features currently consist of: </p> <ul> <li>Infinite canvas (no size limits).</li> <li>Define and edit areas / levels.</li> <li>Define doors (teleportation between areas / levels).</li> <li>Layer support.</li> <li>Sprite collision properties.</li> <li>Custom user added properties.</li> <li>Toolset (draw erase fill).</li> <li>Test the created map using a simple in editor engine (you can create the level while playing).</li> <li>Binary file support (small and efficient files).</li> </ul> <p>Features in progress: - Multiple tile sheet support. - Custom collision bounds. - Save and load sprite sheet setups - Cross filetype support (tmx, lua, json, etc.) - Terrain sets (automatically draw edges, e.g.) - &amp; more.</p> <p>I know this isn’t much yet but if anyone could see the use in this it would give me some motivation to keep working on this.

My first PC was a Commodore 64, my first console a Super Nintendo, and my Gameboy was always in heavy use. But until I was 22, I had never written a single line of code in my life. Becoming a game developer wasn&#39;t even on the list of possibilities. My first degree was in Environmental and Business Management. Taxes were my thing, business management was my great passion. I was successful in my studies, spent semesters abroad in Ireland, had a GPA of 3.8, and then... I fell ill. Severely depressed, one hospital stay after another.</p> <p>But let&#39;s skip the whole journey from psychiatrist to psychiatrist, because I had been misdiagnosed for years, but more on that later.</p> <p>I was exmatriculated because I missed exam registrations, didn&#39;t submit assignments, and never saw the inside of that university again. To avoid a big gap in my resume, I enrolled in the first thing that was available without admission restrictions at the time – computer science. A brainwave that would change the rest of my life.</p> <p>Because my first lecture in Programming 1 was a revelation. Never in my life had anything come as easily to me as understanding syntax and algorithms. A switch to the more practical Media Computer Science followed two years later, along with a cooperative study program at an art school. My luck was a course on computer games. I got in touch with Unity for the first time, developed my first small projects with artists who created the graphics and designs, and I quickly learned how to use gaming engines. I was a sought-after team member, quickly started teaching courses with other students, became a lecturer, and my master&#39;s and my PhD position were already secured.</p> <p>And then I fell ill again... depressed, therapy, everything in my life turned black again.</p> <p>And then I met the person who would shape the next five years of my life. One of my later co-founders – a trans man. We got to know each other, talked a lot, and I was fascinated by how similar our experiences, traumas, and family histories were. And I realized: &quot;He is like me?&quot;. Out of curiosity, I attended the self-help group for trans men and suddenly all my illnesses made sense. The self-hatred, the depressions, the social phobia, the wrong borderline diagnosis... I came out as transgender. One of the best decisions of my life. My family and my environment took it very well, no one questioned my decision or put obstacles in my way. However, the situation with my father, with whom I had always had a very divided relationship, escalated at this time. There was a terrible argument and I knew either he would attack me or I him.</p> <p>Without thinking much about it, I packed my bags and left my parents&#39; house... and suddenly found myself on the street. No entitlement to a student loan, my part-time job couldn&#39;t keep me afloat, no partner or friends where I could stay for a long time. So I became Harry Potter. I didn&#39;t sleep in a cupboard, but on the cupboard of the art studio. Almost four long months, without anyone really noticing. My life took place only at the university, surrounded by creative people and all the projects I was working on. I lived and breathed programming at that time. It was what I loved, what gave me support and strength, what I could do, what I was good at.</p> <p>During this time, I met my future co-founders. People with whom I had already done projects, who were on the same wavelength as me. We worked on our first small project and had the plan for a big game.</p> <p>From a crazy idea, reality slowly emerged, and suddenly I was faced with the decision: do I complete my master&#39;s and pursue a PhD, or do I take the risk and start a game studio with four other megalomaniac freaks...</p> <p>During my time in the studio, I finished my bachelor&#39;s thesis, founded two companies, released our first game, went through my transition, and just before Corona, I also managed to move into my first shared flat. :D</p> <p>Four years later, I am now the managing director of a successful digital agency that specializes in serious games and e-learning, founder and CEO of a game studio, have won several awards with my partners for our company, and have just released the first demos of our game on Steam.</p> <p>Why am I telling this story here?</p> <p>This story is more than just a resume. It is a testament that it is never too late to embark on a new path, no matter how unattainable the goals may seem. It is a call to all those who doubt whether they are too old to start game development, who struggle with their identity, or fear they may never find a foothold in life again:</p> <p>I had never written a single line of code until I was 22.</p> <p>I only completed my bachelor&#39;s degree at 30(!).</p> <p>I didn&#39;t start developing games until I was 26.</p> <p>I was homeless, depressed, at the lowest point of my life, and thought I would never get back on my feet again.</p> <p>As a trans* person, I am a successful and representative managing director of my company. My trans identity has never been an obstacle in this regard.</p> <p>It&#39;s never too late for any dream.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ryan-Konsonautic\"> /u/Ryan-Konsonautic </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amjgbp/from_homeless_to_head_honcho_a_gamers_triumph_how/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amjgbp/from_homeless_to_head_honcho_a_gamers_triumph_how/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T08:21:49+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T08:21:49+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707482868'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amjgbp/from_homeless_to_head_honcho_a_gamers_triumph_how/',\n   'author': '/u/Ryan-Konsonautic',\n   'title': \"From Homeless to Head Honcho: A Gamer's Triumph - How I went from a homeless depressive to a CEO in game development\"},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Unsure if I should ask this question here but..</p> <p>I&#39;m completely new to both Blender and unity but need to use both for a group project.

(&gt; 4 years in my case)</p> <p>I know most people probably know all of this already, but hopefully but I hope someone is able to take the time, code for yourself for once, and make dev life just a little bit easier.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/zaqwertu\"> /u/zaqwertu </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1anwtn1/this_is_your_sign_to_invest_some_time_into_editor/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1anwtn1/this_is_your_sign_to_invest_some_time_into_editor/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-11T02:05:50+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-11T02:05:50+00:00',\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1anwtn1/this_is_your_sign_to_invest_some_time_into_editor/',\n   'tag': 'Unity3D',\n   'author': '/u/zaqwertu',\n   'title': 'This is your sign to invest some time into editor scripting'},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello<br/> I have a friend whose making a game.

Due to reduced number of people, although it was not my area before, i needed to help on production placing props, studying light and techniques to implement and develop pipelines to solve our problems. I spent nights reading documentation, watching tutorials and researching very specific tools and processes to optimize and implement features properly. In my quest of knowledge, i learned a lot about how a computer work, what is an engine and how everything work the way it does under the hood. Now to the topic: an engine is not a trivial thing, you don’t simply decide to build an engine without deep knowledge of game production. Its not a “task” , its a monumental feature that requires many professionals, many of those being world class, to make something as simple as light work. In my opinion, every dev that want to DEVELOP A GAME, should develop with tools available on the market. It makes no sense to me why so many people ask this question because 1 day of research would make it clear of how complex an engine is. Next time you think: should i make my own engine ? If you don’t have a very specific problem that no one solved and a new engine is crucial to develop your idea and you are already an expert on a specific engine , the answer is ALWAYS no, its not worth it and you will probably fail. Now, if you are a coder and want to do for testing your ability (see how this is completely different from making a game) go ahead.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/5spikecelio\"> /u/5spikecelio </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an864t/opinion_if_you_are_asking_if_you_should_use_an/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an864t/opinion_if_you_are_asking_if_you_should_use_an/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-10T04:44:13+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-10T04:44:13+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an864t/opinion_if_you_are_asking_if_you_should_use_an/',\n   'tag': 'gamedev',\n   'author': '/u/5spikecelio',\n   'title': '(OPINION) if you are asking if you should use an existing engine or create a new one for your game, you already answered your question without knowing.'},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Anyone know of a YouTube video, channel or article of what goes on behind the scenes in a game studio?<br/> I wanna study how they operate, what are their day-to-day tasks.<br/> How do they structure the work ahead of them.<br/> And how do they assign roles, like why do they have a lead programmer?

I learned a tangible lesson about getting your core gameplay loops bedded down early in the project that I thought was worth sharing. Keen to know how others navigate these issues.</p> <p>Context: My game&#39;s called Blocky Rockets and it&#39;s a peaceful space adventure about collecting minerals from alien caves. Think casual 2D side-scrolling rocket in a cave. Mobile game.</p> <h1>Problem</h1> <p>Following a bunch of playtesting late last year, I and some testers didn&#39;t feel completely satisfied with how the loops in my game fit together. At that point I was gearing up to polish the game before launch - not mess with the fundamentals.</p> <ol> <li>I had the <strong>primary</strong> / short-term loop established: navigating caves and collecting minerals.</li> <li>I also had the <strong>tertiary</strong> or very long-term loop established: exploring procedural galaxies (these are essentially level containers).</li> <li>But I didn&#39;t have anything satisfying in the middle -- the <strong>secondary</strong> gameplay loop.</li> </ol> <p>People were engaged for a few levels and I think the galaxy exploration feature seemed interesting to people, but there wasn&#39;t anything new to keep you interested across say 2 or 3 play sessions.Gotta get all three loops playing nice.</p> <h1>My solution</h1> <p>I wanted to add collectable fossils to the game post-launch, so I kind of engineered them into the <strong>tertiary</strong> loop to try and solve the engagement problem.</p> <p>Each star system in a galaxy can now host many fragments from a single fossilised species. If you explore the star system (which might take 2 or 3 ten minute play sessions), then you&#39;ll probably find all the fragments and unlock the fossil&#39;s biography.</p> <h1>The lesson</h1> <p>If I built the fossil collection system at the outset, then I:</p> <ol> <li>wouldn&#39;t have broken so much stuff adding it late in the project</li> <li>could have got more feedback on it in earlier test campaigns</li> <li>could have used my pre-launch time more effectively on, you know, pre-launch stuff.</li> </ol> <h1>Keen to learn from your stories too</h1> <p>I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how this could have played out differently, so I&#39;m keen to hear similar stories and especially how you thought about solving a loopy problem.</p> <p>Thanks for reading :)</p> <p>Quick demo on the fossil collection feature (this is from a promo, please ignore the ending I&#39;m not trying to publicise it here):</p> <p><a href=\"https://reddit.com/link/1anap0y/video/1esp8xl3kphc1/player\">https://reddit.com/link/1anap0y/video/1esp8xl3kphc1/player</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/NightHutStudio\"> /u/NightHutStudio </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1anap0y/a_reminder_to_get_your_gameplay_loops_bedded_down/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1anap0y/a_reminder_to_get_your_gameplay_loops_bedded_down/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-10T07:17:48+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-10T07:17:48+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1anap0y/a_reminder_to_get_your_gameplay_loops_bedded_down/',\n   'tag': 'indiegames',\n   'author': '/u/NightHutStudio',\n   'title': 'A reminder to get your gameplay loops bedded down early'},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hey all!The <a href=\"https://discord.gg/wqy8MK49mv\">Indie Game Dev Beginner&#39;s Discord Server</a> is hosting a week-long jam targeted at beginners!</p> <p>Starts: February 15th (next Thursday!)</p> <p>Ends: February 22nd</p> <p>Theme is currently unannounced, but we would love it if you joined us over on <a href=\"https://itch.io/jam/beginners-jam-february-2024\">itch</a>.

So if the Map is 12x12 Regions, and a Region is 30x30 Cells, the Map is subdivided into 360x360 Cells. I only work on the Regions that are adjacent to the player&#39;s coordinates at any given time. Blank ( default ) Cells are ignored, so only Cells with some component are put in any given Regions <code>Cell[] Cells;</code> I check for the Cells proximity, and if one is within interaction range, I make a reference to it in my scene manager as <code>Cell NearestCell</code>.</p> <p>This is where I came across the issue. After interacting with the Cell, I tried to remove the Cell form the array, comparing NearestCell to each Cell in Cells. Something like <code>if(Cells[i] == NearestCell)//etc</code>. However for whatever reason the comparison wasn&#39;t working. So I overrode the operators == and Equals() to get the desired behavior. Doing this meant I had to null check, and obviously since I override == I couldn&#39;t use that, which meant using the <code>is</code> / <code>is not</code> operators: <code>if(cell is not null)//etc</code></p> <p>I understand that there are semantic reasons to use <code>is</code> vs <code>==</code>, and that the right hand arg of <code>is</code> must be a constant, but is there any reason I shouldn&#39;t always use <code>is not null</code>. Are there any rules to overloading these operators? Checking the Docs, MS only seems to offer rules on how to overload <code>GetHashCode()</code>, but not much about best practice for the other operators.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/barisaxo\"> /u/barisaxo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1anrzcd/vs_equals_vs_is/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1anrzcd/vs_equals_vs_is/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-10T22:16:51+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-10T22:16:51+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707616643'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1anrzcd/vs_equals_vs_is/',\n   'tag': 'Unity3D',\n   'author': '/u/barisaxo',\n   'title': \"== vs Equals() vs 'is' ?\"},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame/comments/1amvncn/the_caribbean_legend_demo_was_updated_for_the/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/tCOWmZQOgQRR4GzA27frAYfXzWnAQFVddiiB4x6VP6w.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a80c841489a851b98920b11fb2e57cfdeadb3d34\" alt=\"The Caribbean Legend demo was updated for the Steam Next Fest.

There&#39;s still much that I&#39;m working on, but the core gameplay loop of leveling up and progressing further is completed - just in need of balance adjustments based on your feedback.</p> <p>Reborn is an Idle Roguelike RPG. Here&#39;s what you can expect:</p> <p><strong>Idle Gameplay</strong>: Perfect for multitaskers, Reborn plays on its own in the background. Focus on resource allocation, quest planning, and unraveling the mysteries of a quaint village without constant monitoring.</p> <p><strong>Roguelike Challenges</strong>: Embrace death as a part of your journey. Each demise strips you of your base inventory but not your experience, allowing you to grow stronger and delve deeper into the cave. You can store your inventory outside of the caves, so only take with you what you&#39;re willing to lose.</p> <p><strong>RPG Elements</strong>: Boost your stats with experience points earned. Early levels come cheap, but expect a steep climb as you progress. Craft gear, brew potions, and recruit companions to ease your grind.</p> <p><strong>60 Second Gameplay Demo</strong>: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rRDUptbQblU\">https://youtu.be/rRDUptbQblU</a></p> <p><strong>Core Mechanics</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Mouse &amp; (Limited) Keyboard Support</strong>: While a desktop game, I wanted to challenge myself to make a game that could be played with only mouse clicks. There is still WASD/arrow movement for those that prefer it, but navigating and interacting can all be done with the click of a mouse.</p> <p><strong>Strategic Combat and Exploration</strong>: Engage in battles and find your way through a maze-like cave system. Victory brings you closer to the next challenge.</p> <p><strong>Progressive Gameplay</strong>: Utilize the Auto Battler for cleared floors, focusing your attention on new, uncharted levels when the time comes. Spend experience points in the Barracks to level up and become more formidable.</p> <p><strong>Upcoming Features</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Vibrant NPCs and Village Life</strong>: Interact with unique characters and upgrade your home. I have 19 NPCs in the village, all with intertwining relationships and dramas. Get to know them through what will be up to 100+ different dialogue options as you slowly unravel the mysteries of Reborn.</p> <p><strong>Quests and Potions</strong>: Embark on quests to earn some coin, and brew powerful potions using ingredients from your adventures.</p> <p><strong>Farming and Companions</strong>: Grow your own resources for more powerful brewing, and recruit creatures to aid in your quest in unique ways.</p> <p><strong>Join Our Discord</strong>:</p> <p>I&#39;ve started a dedicated Discord community where you can download the game, share your thoughts, and contribute to the development of Reborn. Your feedback is crucial in refining gameplay, balancing mechanics, and adding new, exciting features. If you&#39;re intrigued by the challenge, eager to contribute to a growing game, and enjoy delving into new worlds, Reborn is waiting for you. If you&#39;re interested in playing without joining the Discord, just DM me and I&#39;ll send you the download link for either PC or Mac.</p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved</strong>:</p> <p><strong>Join our Discord:</strong> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/KxTeWtuN9u\">https://discord.gg/KxTeWtuN9u</a></p> <p><strong>Download Reborn.</strong></p> <p><strong>Share your experience and feedback.</strong></p> <p>Whether you&#39;re a seasoned gamer or new to the scene, your insights are invaluable.

The difference between where I am and what I will add I believe is worth the $10 however I don’t remember any game ever doing this.

With remote players(clients), it is obvious - using networking protocols. But what if I want to avoid using networking layer for the hosting player (client) who created the instance of the server. </p> <p>What about using different calls for the local player? For example: When server sends messages to clients -&gt; &quot;if(player.IsHost) { sendLocalMessage(player,m) }else{ sendNetworkMessage(player,m) }&quot;</p> <p>The &quot;sendLocalMessage(player,m)&quot; would just pass the message to the local client without any networking.</p> <p>Does it make sense?

I am new to Unity, I have done only some very basic XR games back in college.</p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>I am trying to get a small XR project going. For one of the stages of the game I have a script that is supposed to spawn 2 points on user&#39;s hand pinch, and then draw a line between those points. </p> <p>Surprisingly I got the &quot;spawn object on pinch&quot; working just fine, but I am failing to render a visible line between the two spawned objects. I am using a LineRenderer that renders a rile in runtime (is that even a valid approach?). </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p>My code looks like this, </p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><code>private LineRenderer lineRenderer;</code></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><code>void Start()</code></p> <p><code>{</code></p> <p><code>//some code here...</code></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><code>// Initialize the LineRenderer component</code></p> <p><code>lineRenderer = gameObject.AddComponent&lt;LineRenderer&gt;();</code></p> <p><code>lineRenderer.startWidth = 3f; // Set the starting width of the line</code></p> <p><code>lineRenderer.endWidth = 3f; // Set the ending width of the line</code></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><code>// Set the material and color of the line as needed</code></p> <p><code>lineRenderer.material = new Material(Shader.Find(&quot;Sprites/Default&quot;));</code></p> <p><code>lineRenderer.material.color =</code> <a href=\"https://Color.red\"><code>Color.red</code></a><code>;</code></p> <p>&#x200B;</p> <p><code>lineRenderer.positionCount = 2;</code></p> <p><code>void DrawLineAndMeasure() //this gets called in update</code></p> <p><code>{</code></p> <p><code>if (pointA != null &amp;&amp; pointB != null)</code></p> <p><code>{</code></p> <p><code>Debug.Log(&quot;DrawLine was called&quot;);</code></p> <p><code>lineRenderer.positionCount = 2;</code></p> <p><code>lineRenderer.SetPosition(0, pointA.transform.position);</code></p> <p><code>lineRenderer.SetPosition(1, pointB.transform.position);</code></p> <p><code>}</code></p> <p>I am able to verify that indeed this method gets called with the debug statement, there&#39;s just NO line in the AR space being drawn.

Instead, use surveys, interviews, and gameplay data to refine your understanding.</p> <p>So if you want to deepen your understanding on player archetypes I’ve written a <a href=\"https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/gamer-types/?utm_source=organic&amp;utm_medium=reddit\">post</a> where I go over some models: </p> <ul> <li>Bartle’s Player Taxonomy </li> <li>Self-Determination Theory </li> <li>HEXAD </li> <li>Quantic Foundry</li> </ul> <p><a href=\"https://gamedesignskills.com/game-design/gamer-types/?utm_source=organic&amp;utm_medium=reddit\">In this post</a>, I’ll also go over my process for designing with player archetypes in mind.</p> <p>By deeply integrating the understanding of player archetypes into your game development process, you pave the way for creating immersive, engaging experiences that appeal to a broad spectrum of players.</p> <p>I&#39;m curious to hear your thoughts on the usefulness of player archetypes and which model has served you the best.</p> <p>As always, thanks for reading.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Xelnath\"> /u/Xelnath </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an4dyx/a_quick_guide_on_player_archetypes_for_aspiring/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an4dyx/a_quick_guide_on_player_archetypes_for_aspiring/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-10T01:24:22+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-10T01:24:22+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1an4dyx/a_quick_guide_on_player_archetypes_for_aspiring/',\n   'tag': 'gamedev',\n   'author': '/u/Xelnath',\n   'title': 'A quick guide on player archetypes for aspiring game designers aiming to reach a broader audience.'},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I have a simple game idea about a 2d platformer where at first you try to go through an obstacle course, then in the next round you spawn in with weapons and have to stop your previous self from passing, then you spawn as the platformer again and have to pass the level while avoiding attacks from your previous self and so on...</p> <p>Can you tell me how i can iterate on this idea to make it more fun and balanced for both attacking and traversing?</p> <p>Also what might be ultimate goal of each level?

Also I haven&#39;t spent 15 years working on a single game, it&#39;s 15 years across my entire gamedev career.</p> <p>When I was 12 years old we had to write about what we wanted to do when we grew up, I said &#39;I&#39;m not sure what I want to do, but I know it&#39;ll have something to do with videogames&#39;. I got all the other kids in my class to help me design a game on paper, coming up with levels, storylines, weapons etc. Then one day someone asked &#39;So Tav534, how are we actually going to make it?&#39;. This question stopped 12 year old me in my tracks and I was speechless. This was before the days of Unity (at least before it became popular) and basically no schools in my country taught coding for our age group. After a few months I was browsing some flash game websites and came across an interview with a developer I idolised, saying he used Adobe Flash CS4 to make his games, that anyone could do it, but mathematics and algebra knowledge and were important. Suddenly I paid more attention in maths class than ever before.</p> <p>When I was 13 I moved to a new school, losing all my &#39;employees&#39; but now I knew how to make flash games. For anyone unfamiliar, flash games were internet browser games made with Adobe Flash. I also decided I was going to be wiser and more reasonable, instead of making a 3D shooter with production qualities similar to Halo 3 I was going to narrow my focus down to making the best 2D game ever. I was starting to become more realistic with my expectations, not quite there yet but I had the spirit. I was stuck in a loop of failing to make games then lowering my expectations, until I finally made a simple point and click game about the zombie apocalypse. It was bad. Terrible. But let me tell you something about gamedev back in those days. These days games are easier than ever to make, but because of that there&#39;s more games than ever to compete with. When I uploaded my first terrible game onto Kongregate (a free flash game website) it was much easier to get attention. I got almost 2000 players and I was hooked. I loved making games, good or terrible, because I loved hearing what people thought about them.</p> <p>I spent a lot of time during highschool making flash games. They weren&#39;t great, you&#39;ve never heard of them. I created a team with a few other developers from Kongregate and got 50,000 players across 20 different games, and about $25 in ad revenue. When highschool ended life got busy and the team parted ways. By about this time Steam was getting popular, but they only let AAA games on their platform. I thought my gamedev career was over and it was time to enter the real world. Truth be told, I was terrible at making games. I kid you not, I didn&#39;t even know what a boolean was. I started studying psychology at university and dabbled with gamedev over the holidays. It took me 5 years but I finally learnt about &#39;If statements&#39;, I didn&#39;t know other conditionals existed. In my final year of psychology I took a unit in coding just for fun, and flunked the unit with a grade of 25% and a final exam score of 15%. So naturally I decided to enrol in a software degree.</p> <p>At this age I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to do for a job, but I figured I might as well learn how to code so I could make better games. This software course was particularly brutal, 50% of students would fail or drop out in the first semester of the first year, and another 50% of that in the second semester. I hung on out of pure determination, I would literally attend the same class ten times in a row so I could get help with assignments from the teachers. I worked harder than I ever did in highschool and my psychology degree. Somehow I survived, and somehow I met my wife in one of the classes and proposed a few months later.</p> <p>I graduated narrowly missing out on a high distinction by less than a percent, but still very proud of myself. Perhaps I should have started my post here instead of ending it, but before my graduation I began learning how to use Godot to make RPGs. I got some good reception to my first project, but scrapped it because the code was a nightmare to handle. I got older and wiser. And after a few years of Godot experience I began making Aletheia: Return of Odysseus, and now two years later I&#39;ve finally announced the game on <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1565070/Aletheia_Return_of_Odysseus/\">Steam</a>. There&#39;s still a long way to go. I&#39;m not going to end this mini-memoir with any clever remarks or satisfying conclusions, just thank you for hearing my story.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Tav534\"> /u/Tav534 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amfmvx/after_15_years_of_gamedev_i_finally_have_my_first/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amfmvx/after_15_years_of_gamedev_i_finally_have_my_first/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T04:25:21+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T04:25:21+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707482868'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1amfmvx/after_15_years_of_gamedev_i_finally_have_my_first/',\n   'author': '/u/Tav534',\n   'title': 'After 15 years of gamedev, I finally have my first game on Steam'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amyd70/demons_of_evil_from_my_game_morganica_are_they/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rfgVqsl_-gf5A5Wb9D9kWJwARKWW2qwHQzgYM_ePMRU.jpg\" alt=\"Demons of Evil from my game Morganica, are they cool and scary enough?\" title=\"Demons of Evil from my game Morganica, are they cool and scary enough?\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/MadDivision\"> /u/MadDivision </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1amyd70\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amyd70/demons_of_evil_from_my_game_morganica_are_they/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T20:53:40+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T20:53:40+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amyd70/demons_of_evil_from_my_game_morganica_are_they/',\n   'tag': 'indiegames',\n   'author': '/u/MadDivision',\n   'title': 'Demons of Evil from my game Morganica, are they cool and scary enough?'},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>im looking for a game engine that has normal maps, 2d support, and preferably some sort of visual scripting or general ease of use.

Thing is, all tutorials show how to make a somewhat complex, procedurally generated one that realistically follows the movement of the sword. I&#39;m making a low poly game so I just want the trail to look &quot;flat&quot;, like a piece of paper behind the sword. Can I do this within Unity? I am decent with Blender but I don&#39;t know if that would make a good workflow.<br/> A good reference may be the sword characters in Smash Ultimate. A simple flat texture that follows the sword, in a game with set animations instead of procedurally generated ones. I also would like to control the frames during which the trail shows: for example, the sword does a quick swing and stays in the final pose for a couple frames, but the trail disappears a little before the animation ends.<br/> Thank you very much.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Somin1\"> /u/Somin1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unity/comments/1am22qk/what_would_be_the_best_way_to_make_a_simple_sword/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/unity/comments/1am22qk/what_would_be_the_best_way_to_make_a_simple_sword/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-08T18:10:37+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-08T18:10:37+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707482868'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/unity/comments/1am22qk/what_would_be_the_best_way_to_make_a_simple_sword/',\n   'author': '/u/Somin1',\n   'title': 'What would be the best way to make a simple sword trail?'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1amqj0a/im_remaking_the_ui_of_my_hacker_raccoon_game_any/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/MXI5ZG9wdm11a2hjMRqnHWIuUB1f032LnyUal_bcU7gov_CuZZzEFh9d_CCC.png?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da7727dea376a02321e2dfb588dd8f419b4cc148\" alt=\"I\\'m remaking the UI of my hacker raccoon game, any thoughts?\" title=\"I\\'m remaking the UI of my hacker raccoon game, any thoughts?\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Botpa69\"> /u/Botpa69 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://v.redd.it/kmkwu6vutkhc1\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1amqj0a/im_remaking_the_ui_of_my_hacker_raccoon_game_any/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T15:21:29+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T15:21:29+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1amqj0a/im_remaking_the_ui_of_my_hacker_raccoon_game_any/',\n   'tag': 'Unity3D',\n   'author': '/u/Botpa69',\n   'title': \"I'm remaking the UI of my hacker raccoon game, any thoughts?\"},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I understand the gist.

I know in the game dev world that does not mean anything without a solid portfolio. I took a game design module in my final year and got very good marks on it.</p> <p>I also have a bit of experience with a number of graphics/ animation software systems including Blender. I have a passion for art too and have dedicated a lot of time to getting better at it in several mediums. </p> <p>I have been told that my experience would be highly suited to certain areas of game design and post production and after investigating I found out about the technical artist role. </p> <p>I have read that this is a often mid level role that people transition into but I would be interested to know of what kind of roles to look for currently that could then neatly lead into a technical artist role?</p> <p>On that point, I know that my graphics/ animation skills are more lacking than my programming skills and would need to improve in that area. I thought while improving I would build up a technical artist portfolio to then try and get work with that.</p> <p>I have seen a few masters courses that would teach and allow for me to work on my graphics/ animation/ technical artist skills and add to my portfolio. I found one which does not teach you any hard skills and instead personal project management skills essentially where you focus on one big project to use in your portfolio <a href=\"https://www.port.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/msc-creative-technologies#how-youll-spend-your-time\">https://www.port.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/msc-creative-technologies#how-youll-spend-your-time</a></p> <p>It seems the one thing it has though is some state of the art looking facilities <a href=\"https://www.port.ac.uk/research/research-groups-and-centres/ccixr#future\">https://www.port.ac.uk/research/research-groups-and-centres/ccixr#future</a> Although I am not sure if I would really need these to help me make anything that would make a AAA gaming company more likely to hire me than if I were to make projects on my own and save a significant amount of money. I feel I can be quite motivated when working regardless. If anyone has any thoughts on the utility of such a course though, I’d be very grateful.</p> <p>Also if anyone has any thoughts on if perusing a masters in general would significantly help my chances of landing a technical artist job for any reason considering where I am coming from? I just feel I can learn what I’d need to know online and then be able to build my own projects for my portfolio myself too.</p> <p>And if there are any other areas in gaming or post production where artistic and programming abilities can be used together, that would be helpful to know too!</p> <p>Thank you for reading!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Ellipsoidz\"> /u/Ellipsoidz </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ankc8i/technical_artist_pathway/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ankc8i/technical_artist_pathway/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-10T16:38:52+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-10T16:38:52+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707616643'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1ankc8i/technical_artist_pathway/',\n   'tag': 'gamedev',\n   'author': '/u/Ellipsoidz',\n   'title': 'Technical artist pathway'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame/comments/1ams09n/been_cooking_up_something_latelylet_him_cook/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/d8zv6DITPHzEm9bbBO1VbKHtQWeyE07MkzC_ws5onHU.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=729bc34eb64433f533cbd9dcf7c27ec484c4ed57\" alt=\"Been cooking up something lately...LET HIM COOK major demo update out now!\" title=\"Been cooking up something lately...LET HIM COOK major demo update out now!\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/mannyisshort\"> /u/mannyisshort </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCFRAZl0hJg\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame/comments/1ams09n/been_cooking_up_something_latelylet_him_cook/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T16:25:18+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T16:25:18+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/playmygame/comments/1ams09n/been_cooking_up_something_latelylet_him_cook/',\n   'tag': 'playmygame',\n   'author': '/u/mannyisshort',\n   'title': 'Been cooking up something lately...LET HIM COOK major demo update out now!'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amnmrb/sharing_with_you_guys_a_scene_i_made_for_the/\"> <img src=\"https://external-preview.redd.it/7v2h7zYhOcU2Z5IhMoCao5nI3bIwH64CoNWFp_Cdk4c.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8984ee857c38a4cf91c6c707da64f8c9b1260ca1\" alt=\"Sharing with you guys a scene I made for the upcoming game trailer.\" title=\"Sharing with you guys a scene I made for the upcoming game trailer.\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/vanpat1\"> /u/vanpat1 </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2v6lPUTM-A\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amnmrb/sharing_with_you_guys_a_scene_i_made_for_the/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T13:01:16+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T13:01:16+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707483752'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amnmrb/sharing_with_you_guys_a_scene_i_made_for_the/',\n   'tag': 'indiegames',\n   'author': '/u/vanpat1',\n   'title': 'Sharing with you guys a scene I made for the upcoming game trailer.'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amui1e/added_cozy_building_system_to_cozy_crest_let_me/\"> <img src=\"https://preview.redd.it/9osetbtznlhc1.gif?width=640&amp;crop=smart&amp;s=96d5f316e49a76a86c8de4ecfadc42b6a2b078ab\" alt=\"Added Cozy Building System to Cozy Crest, let me know what you think\" title=\"Added Cozy Building System to Cozy Crest, let me know what you think\" /> </a> </td><td> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/Unlaed\"> /u/Unlaed </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://i.redd.it/9osetbtznlhc1.gif\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amui1e/added_cozy_building_system_to_cozy_crest_let_me/\">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T18:08:14+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T18:08:14+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amui1e/added_cozy_building_system_to_cozy_crest_let_me/',\n   'tag': 'indiegames',\n   'author': '/u/Unlaed',\n   'title': 'Added Cozy Building System to Cozy Crest, let me know what you think'},\n  {'content': '<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Hello fellow game devs ! </p> <p>For those interested I&#39;ve created a Fiverr-like domain purely for Game Devs (all the roles within Devs,management, level design,art, etc).

The one where the main camera is separated to three eye anchors (Left, Centre, Right and is named OVRCameraRig) I have some questions that I really need the answers to.</p> <p>1) How do I check if I am using forward/deferred rendering in my project? I heard forward is better for performance. And what is multipass and multiview? Which one do I use? Some Youtuber recommended to change to multiview. 2) How to optimize game for performance? I am struggling to get smooth fps despite not having a lot of details on my scene. Scene only had a few things like Terrain (painted with some static trees, foliages from NatureManufacture&#39;s assets), House, a Lake and River (RAM 2019), some VFXs through Particle System, and a few lights, but the game was so choppy when I tested it on the headset! 3) Are shadows a yeah or nah? Do I go with soft or hard shadows? 4) Do I use realtime/mixed/baked lighting? I don&#39;t have much moving objects in the scene except the player itself and some doors opening and closing, but I won&#39;t even see my player. I assume I will have to bake my lighting...?</p> <p>Also I had issues building the game just to test all my interactions, compiling shaders took a really long time (it took me 15-30 mins just to build a single scene) and last time I checked I had about 150+ shader variants. I don&#39;t know much about shaders but when I imported NatureManufacture&#39;s assets, I saw a lot of shaders.</p> <p>Essentially what are the Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts when building a game for VR? Can anyone link me a page where I can read more about this? Or is there anyone who is willing to call on Discord and run through my project and tweak all the settings together? I am willing to pay you for your time so please slide me a DM if you are experienced with VR matters. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/shahkiddoo\"> /u/shahkiddoo </a> <br/> <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1amzjxm/questions_regarding_vr/\">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1amzjxm/questions_regarding_vr/\">[comments]</a></span>',\n   'published': '2024-02-09T21:44:50+00:00',\n   'updated': '2024-02-09T21:44:50+00:00',\n   'rss_write_time': Decimal('1707566221'),\n   'entry_url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/1amzjxm/questions_regarding_vr/',\n   'tag': 'Unity3D',\n   'author': '/u/shahkiddoo',\n   'title': 'Questions regarding VR'},\n  {'content': '<table> <tr><td> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/indiegames/comments/1amn32m/tutorial_slides_being_descriptive_vs_having_less/\"> <img src=\"https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/rq-VzzEYmksLphYDYszIopVzzbgNsXOuADuxeeG4GfQ.jpg\" alt=\"Tutorial slides!

The moderation team has recently become aware of the nefarious activities of a group known as <strong>P1 - Virtual Civilization Initiative</strong> or, more precisely, their <strong>Covenant</strong> group, and it is our responsibility to issue a community-wide alert.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong></p> <p>After receiving multiple reports and carefully investigating the matter, it has become evident that P1 is engaging in highly unethical practices. While many shady things are taking place within P1 and have been for years, the operators of P1 are now participating in a fraud that targets naive or inexperienced individuals looking to begin their game development careers.</p> <p>For those who have been contacted by P1 or have been considering speaking to them. <strong>DO NOT PAY THEM (OR BID) TO JOIN A TEAM OF VOLUNTEERS</strong>. Want training or an education? Find an accredited college or university. </p> <p><strong>Community Safety:</strong></p> <p>Considering these findings, we have decided to remove any trace we find of P1 within our community. Taking a strong stance against such behaviour is essential to maintaining the integrity and safety of our collaborative space. </p> <p>Steps are also being taken to remove their access to as many game development communities as possible on Reddit and Discord.</p> <p><strong>Your Role:</strong></p> <p>Refrain from initiating or participating in any activities involving P1 and warn anyone you know who that organization may have contacted. If you happen to encounter any content related to P1, please report it immediately to the moderation team for swift action.</p> <p>----</p> <p>We appreciate your cooperation on this.

Second week in and this really inspired the iteration and planning this week. Many of the comments still under works, so sorry for the weekly spam. This week added more ewww sludgines with the sludge trail. Sludge also builds up by consuming and is needed to climb walls etc. Added simple destructables, so the bigger the the blob is, the bigger things it can now break. Adding same logic to consuming. First you can consume small species and move up towards humans. Improved blob performance. Started building city generation and population systems. Forgot again to remove the ”shard”, and designed a layout for the goaling.

The goal is to provide a viable alternative to SpeedTree without developers having to sell their kidneys 😅.

I value my time at low level developer so let&#39;s say $21 USD an hour.
